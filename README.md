# Keras-RetinaNet

This Repository conatains Implementation of RetinaNet from Scratch Using TensorFlow/Keras. The Backbone Used is ResNet50 which is built-in
in TensorFlow/Keras. 
You can train the Model on Your Custom Dataset as well as you can train it on official COCO dataset.

In dataset.py file set data_dir=None to train on full COCO dataset, on leave it as it is to train on smaller dataset (500 images) and you can prepare you custom dataset 
as well.
